\begin{abstract}

In this paper we study, for the first time explicitly, the
implications of allowing an interested party (i.e. a teacher) the
ability to modify the underlying \emph{dynamics} of the environment,
in order to encourage an agent to learn to follow a specific
policy. We introduce a cost function which can be used by the
interested party to balance the modifications it makes to the
underlying environment dynamics, with the learner's performance
compared to some ideal, desired, policy. We formulate the interested
party's problem of determining optimal environment changes as a
planning and control problem, and empirically validate the
effectiveness of our model.
