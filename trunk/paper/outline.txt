Introduction and Related Work

   * Environment Design (Zhang and Parkes)
   * Reward Shaping (we should discuss how ED and RL differ or are the same)
   * Work by Peter Stone and Gal Kaminka ("teaching by example")

   We also need to include a concrete example -- most likely a bike
   riding example where changes are made to the bike. We need to
   ensure that the example used matches our problem formulation -- and
   in particular the cost function.

Model

   This is the most important section.  

   * Describe interaction
   including agent and teacher's roles and responsibilities. We should
   emphasize that the teacher may or may not be benevolent/adversarial
   - that we can capture both (and anything in between)
   * Specialise to an MDP environment
   * Describe measure/cost -- in particular the use of KL-rate
   * Emphasize the generic use of a policy update rule

Optimization Problem (Instantiation)

   * Define the optimize problem and then provide a particular
     instantiation of it (policy iteration).

Experimental Setup

   * Goals of this section are to show feasibility of our approach and
     to compare qualitatively with other related approaches
     (reward-based ones?)

Future Work and Conclusions

   * Variations -- in particular re-emphasize that policy iteration is
     not required -- just need a policy update rule.  Talk about how
     it might be useful in transfer learning.
   * Variations of the cost function (relative difference)
